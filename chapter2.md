# Characteristics of GIT
## Snapshot-Based Versioning:

Git stores complete snapshots of the project at different points in time. Snapshots capture everything in the project, including history and metadata.

## Optimized for Local Development:

Git is distributed, allowing each user to have a complete copy of the project locally.Working offline is possible, with changes synced to the remote server when online.

## Explicit Commands:

Git requires explicit commands for every action.Users have complete control over when and how actions are performed.
## Supports Non-Linear Development:

Git facilitates branching, allowing for parallel timelines of development.
Branching is lightweight and inexpensive, enabling experimentation without affecting the main timeline.

These characteristics lay the foundation for understanding Git's functionality and workflow.
